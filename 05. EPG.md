# **Endpoint Group**

### What is an Endpoint Group (EPG)?

An Endpoint Group (EPG) in the context of a data center is a collection of endpoints (such as servers, virtual machines, or devices) that share common networking and policy requirements. EPGs are used to group together devices that need to communicate with each other under the same set of rules and policies.

### Example to Illustrate an Endpoint Group

Let's use our office building example with the three companies (Tenants) and their departments.

#### Office Building Example:
- **Company A**: Has Sales, HR, and IT departments.
- **Company B**: Has Sales, HR, and IT departments.
- **Company C**: Has Sales, HR, and IT departments.

Each department within each company has specific devices (computers, printers, servers) that need to communicate with each other and sometimes with devices in other departments.

### Creating Endpoint Groups (EPGs)

1. **EPG-Sales**: Contains all the devices used by the Sales department within a company.
2. **EPG-HR**: Contains all the devices used by the HR department within a company.
3. **EPG-IT**: Contains all the devices used by the IT department within a company.

#### Company A Example:

- **EPG-Sales-A**: Includes all endpoints (computers, printers, servers) used by the Sales department in Company A.
- **EPG-HR-A**: Includes all endpoints used by the HR department in Company A.
- **EPG-IT-A**: Includes all endpoints used by the IT department in Company A.

#### Company B Example:

- **EPG-Sales-B**: Includes all endpoints used by the Sales department in Company B.
- **EPG-HR-B**: Includes all endpoints used by the HR department in Company B.
- **EPG-IT-B**: Includes all endpoints used by the IT department in Company B.

### Policies and Communication

Each EPG can have specific policies that define how the devices within the group can communicate with each other and with devices in other EPGs. For instance:

- **Policy for EPG-Sales-A**: Sales department devices can access the internet, internal sales databases, and shared printers, but cannot access HR or IT resources directly.
- **Policy for EPG-HR-A**: HR department devices can access internal HR databases, shared printers, and communication tools but cannot access Sales or IT resources directly.
- **Policy for EPG-IT-A**: IT department devices can access all internal resources for maintenance and support purposes, including Sales and HR resources, but access is controlled and monitored.

### Visual Representation

```
Company A:
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
|   EPG-Sales-A     |      |    EPG-HR-A       |      |    EPG-IT-A       |
| - Sales Computers |      | - HR Computers    |      | - IT Computers    |
| - Sales Printers  |      | - HR Printers     |      | - IT Servers      |
| - Sales Servers   |      | - HR Servers      |      | - IT Printers     |
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+

Company B:
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
|   EPG-Sales-B     |      |    EPG-HR-B       |      |    EPG-IT-B       |
| - Sales Computers |      | - HR Computers    |      | - IT Computers    |
| - Sales Printers  |      | - HR Printers     |      | - IT Servers      |
| - Sales Servers   |      | - HR Servers      |      | - IT Printers     |
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
```

### Summary

- **Endpoint Group (EPG)**: A logical grouping of endpoints (devices) that share common networking and policy requirements.
- **Example in Office Building**: In a company, departments like Sales, HR, and IT can each have their own EPGs, containing all relevant devices.
- **Policies**: Each EPG can have specific policies defining how devices within the group communicate with each other and with other EPGs.

By organizing devices into EPGs, data centers can efficiently manage and apply policies, ensuring that devices within the same group can communicate seamlessly while enforcing necessary security and access controls.
